Victims of Domestic Violence often do not have the capability to reach out to emergency responders during an assault or even have a medical evaluation after the event. Using computer vision to detect aggressive behavior before it escalates, OpenDV notifies local emergency services of the assault via text message. 

With the alwaysAI API, the Raspberry Pi camera detects "power" poses which indicate violence occurring. The Twilio SMS API sends a notification to law enforcement that there is a domestic disturbance with a pin on the location, so that officers and paramedics are prepared to arrive on the scene. 

The device is meant to be small and discrete so the user can hide it somewhere in the home while still capturing the assault as it is happening. With the victim choosing to use the device, they consent with sharing their information, accept help from law enforcement and seek medical attention. 

From a legal standpoint, domestic violence is physical or psychological abuse from a person to their partner or child; the use of this device would be when a victim is desperate for help. The information and usage would aid a legal case with grounds of habitual abuse, if applicable, and of one particular instance of violence.
