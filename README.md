Victims of Domestic Violence often do not have the capability to reach out to emergency responders during an assault. Using computer vision to detect agressive behavior before it escalates, OpenDV notifies local authorities of the assault via text message. 
With the alwaysAI API, the raspberry pi camera detects "power" poses which indicate violence occuring. The Twilio SMS API sends a notification to law enforcement that there is a domestic disturbance with a pin on the location, so that officers are prepared to arrive on the scene. 
The device is meant to be small and discrete so the user can hide it somewhere in the home while still capturing the assault as it is  happening. With the victim choosing to use the device, they consent with sharing their information and accept help from law enforcement.
